# Tax Map
Have you ever wanted to browse tax rates by location? Well there isn't a central place to just explore tax rates location by location. You would just find yourself googling 5 queries to figure out the total tax from Federal, State, County, and City. 
That is where Tax Map comes in!

The first iteration of this project is to offer an interactive map that displays the state income tax rate of single filers. On hover it will display the tax rates of the state.

`Node.js` as the runtime environment, `React.js` with `Leaflet` for the frontend UI, and a `Flask` backend server to serve state tax data from a CSV. The dataset I used was from Tax Foundation Organization [https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/state/state-income-tax-rates/].
